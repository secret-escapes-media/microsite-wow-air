  title: The Blue Lagoon
  highlight: true
  content: You won't want to miss the Blue Lagoon, the world's largest and most famous geothermal spa. The steamy hot spring is unbelievably scenic, even by Icelandic standards, thanks to the surrounding beds of lava and the mineral-rich water's eponymous hue – an electric ice blue that appears to glow in the light of the midnight sun. Be sure to make reservations in advance of your visit, and consider slotting in a massage, atop a pool float, or a cocktail at the swim-up bar.

  title: Northern Lights
  highlight: true
  content: From roughly September and October to March and April, the famed Aurora Borealis dances across the sky, neon green, red and blue "streamers" shimmering in the night. It's a truly spectacular sight, but just as exciting as viewing the display is tracking it down. Join a guided tour, or if you're willing to travel outside of the city on your own, such as on a cross-country road trip, consult one of the wintertime Northern Lights forecasting services.

  content: Down on the South Coast lies Reynisfjara Beach, one of the most striking seashores not just on the island, but on the planet. Take in the volcanic black sands, caves and basalt columns early in the morning or late in the afternoon, and you may be able to miss the tour buses, and pretend you have the place to yourself. As you gape at the exquisite vistas, also take care to follow all guidelines, staying on the marked trails and avoiding heading into the water.

  title: Whale watching
  highlight: true
  content: Humpbacks, orcas, blue whales, sperm whales and minke whales are just a few of the most commonly sighted cetaceans around the Icelandic coast – bountiful herring and krill make the Arctic and North Atlantic waters particularly enticing for these and other majestic marine mammals. April through September is the best time for whale-watching, but if you come off season, Reykjavik boasts an exhibition of life-sized whale models, and there's  a dedicated whale museum in Husavik.

  title: The Ring Road
  highlight: true
  content: Iceland's Ring Road, or Route 1, connects hiking trails, volcanoes, national parks, geothermal spas, glaciers, lookouts and hundreds of coastal towns and cities. Driving its full 800-mile length is a great way to see the whole country, if you can set aside a good seven or more days to complete the journey in summer, and 10 or more in winter. Spend your nights at hotels and inns, or when the weather's nice, camp out in a tent or camper van.

  title: Thingvellir National Park
  highlight: true
  content: Thingvellir National Park is known for its history, most of all – "Thingvellir" translates to "the fields of parliament," as this UNESCO World Heritage-protected national park began as a gathering place for Icelandic clan representatives. Of course, being in rural Iceland, it offers plenty of natural beauty, in the form of rocky ravines, gorges and lava fields. Never mind its location, in the rift valley at the intersection of Europe and Asia...

  title: Geysir Geothermal Area
  highlight: true
  content: The English word "geyser" originates from the Icelandic word "geysir," meaning "something that gushes," and a geyser that gushes up to 200-odd feet in the air – when active, that is – resides at the center of the Geysir Geothermal Area. This entire park sits upon boiling, bubbling cauldrons, so even if when the geyser is taking some time off, you'll encounter mud vents, steam vents, streams and hot springs on your visit to this second of the Golden Circle sights.

  highlight: true
  content: From top to bottom, the two-tiered Gullfoss Waterfall, dating back to the Ice Age, measures more than 100 feet. The glacial waters of this cascade, the largest-volume falls in Europe, then plunge into a crevice of nearly 100 feet, resulting in another iconic Golden Circle vista. On your visit to this third and last of the circle's Big Three, also be sure to visit the memorial to activist Sigridur Tomasdottir, who saved the waterfall from development.

  content: When you're in need of some fuel between stops on the Golden Circle, look no further than Friðheimar, where 18% of the tomatoes in Iceland – that's roughly 370 tons per year – are grown in the greenhouses of a working farm. At its Condé Nast Traveler-endorsed, tomato-themed signature restaurant, you can lunch among the tomato stalks, sampling tomato-basil tortillas, tomato soup and even tomato ice cream, before purchasing a jar of tomato sauce or chutney as a souvenir.

  content: The Golden Circle holds a scattering of lesser-known spots, along with the "Big Three," and one of these is the steamy secret geothermal lagoon in the village of Fludir, featuring Iceland's oldest swimming pool. Bathe in waters that hover around 100 degrees Fahrenheit year-round, and watch a small geyser erupt every five or so minutes – if you swing by at the right time of winter, you may even catch a sighting of those elusive Northern Lights.

Fit in a visit to the Sun Voyager sculpture or one of the parks and plazas, as well.
